The program will help you to create your own music in a easy way and also will help you to check the ideas that you have in mind and save them in a .txt file so you can see them later or modify them in the program. 


## Functions of the program:

```python
Options:

1) Create the base of a new song
2) Check chords affinity 
3) Save your song idea
4) Modify your ideas
```

* Create the base of a song consist in selecting the tone the we want it, and then select the complexity, then the program is going to print the chords that the song will have (applying musical theory).


* The part of checking the chords affinity is related to the previous point so it will use musical theory to see if all it's correct or if there is be a possible wrong chord


* The third option will ask you for the data of the song, like tone, the name of the song, style, chord and that info will go to a .txt file to save all the proyects that you want


* The option of modify your ideas will be to modify the proyects that are already in the .txt file, so we can change the info of a proyect that we have created.
